Method to Import .csv files on Windows:
1. Format csv file to structure of related table (make sure to remove column headers)
(OPTIONAL) Move csv file to directory of DB - no need to specify filePath in step 4

2. Download from https://www.sqlite.org/
sqlite-tools-win-x64-3460000.zip
extract to DB directory

3.
For Command Prompt
cd to folder with .db file and sqlite3.exe
Enter: sqlite3.exe "Hazardous Materials Database.db"

For PowerShell
cd to folder with .db file and sqlite3.exe
Enter: ./sqlite3.exe '.\Hazardous Materials Database.db'


4. (May need to enter ".mode csv" first, than shouldn't need --csv)
Enter: .import filePath/fileName.csv tableName --csv

*This should append to table, so to be safe, it'd be best to format all data for each table and only import once, then use front end for new changes

**There are likely easier ways to import using various programs like SQLite Studio, but this is how example testing data was inserted
